- 👋 Hi, I’m Maggie.
- 👀 I’m interested in transitioning to tech from law! My github repositories currently show work I'm doing through The Odin Project and Colt Steele's Modern Python 3 Bootcamp.
- 🌱 I’m currently having fun learning the basics :)
- 📫 Look for mbarnestech on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Trailblazer.me - or set up a coffee chat with me here: https://calendly.com/mbarnestech/coffee_chat

mbarnestech/mbarnestech is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

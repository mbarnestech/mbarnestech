- 👋 Hi, I’m @mbarnestech
- 👀 I’m interested in: transitioning to tech from law! I'm still learning what that means, but I'm focusing on Salesforce for now and working through The Odin Project (currently on foundations, anticipating taking the Ruby Track) to learn Full Stack Development focusing on Backend Development for broader flexibility in the long term.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basic!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: helping each other learn! I'd love to have a small accountability group.
- 📫 How to reach me: Search for username / profile ID mbarnestech on LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, and Trailblazer.me.
